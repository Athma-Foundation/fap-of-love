### Know issues

- Too much use of "moral police" in the doc. If you know a better pronoun or a shorter phrase I can use, kindly let me know. 
- I tend to use swear words. So do not file bug reports asking me to remove them. I won't. You can fork this and make a child-safe saintly version that's less offensive if you choose to.
