### Why the name?

I was speaking to a friend of mine and said it'll be a nice idea to create an easy to refer FAQ for people who want to know more about moral policing. He thought it was a fine idea. I also told him we should also include frequently argued about points supportive of moral policing like culture. That would be FAPs. And this was created with the Kiss of Love campaign in mind, so I wondered out loud "how about fap of love?". He found it amusing. I liked it too. It's dumb, but I like it. So
there you go.

For those who are not familiar with the word "fap", I'll let Urban Dictionary do the honours:

    The onomatopoeic representation of masturbation. Often used to 
     suggest that something is attractive.

### Known issues

- Too much use of the phrase "moral police" in the doc. If you know a better pronoun or a shorter phrase I can use, kindly let me know. 
- I tend to use swear words. So do not file bug reports asking me to remove them. I won't. You can fork this and make a child-safe saintly version that's less offensive if you choose to.
- Not enough contributors, I'm just a single person and it's easy for my biases and fallacies to slip in. I need more people to review, critique and contribute content. Kindly use the issues section or send us an email.
