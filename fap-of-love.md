# Frequently Asked (often unanswered) Questions 

## For the uninitiated and the ignorant

1. What is moral policing?
    Moral policing is vigilantism against perceived moral code of a certain society against people who are thought to be acting in a manner that undermines the narrow world view of the vigilante. In plain English, this is the act of policing by people who have a set of moral codes etched in their brains and who think other people should conform to the codes irrespective of whether or not the constitution of the society guarantees certain rights to the people in a democratic country. 

    Let us break down the sentence. Moral police refers to people with no legal authority and not actuall legally appointed law enforcement personnel. Also worth noting is that law enforcement personnel should do exactly what the name suggests: enforce the law. Last I heard, it is legal to kiss somebody in public or hold hands with ones partner. Any law enforcement personnel asking people to NOT hold hands is engaging in moral policing. Moral polcing makes sense only in a country that
    allows for certain freedoms and liberties. In a totallitarean or dictatorship state, it might be against the law to engage in PDA or drink liquor. That is moral policing by the state and is very fucked up. That is not what we are talking about in this FAQ though. Also merely frowning upon or mumbling under their breath or cursing or cussing is not moral policing. Moral policing involves intervention, disruption, violence and direct physical or verbal abuse.

2. Where can I find moral policing?
    In India, big time. And in several other (often religious) countries. The wikipedia article on moral policing points squarely to India. 

3. What is the difference between moral policing and policing by law-enforcement authorities?
    If the person doing the policing does not have legal authority, i.e, if he does not hold a valid police ID card, then it is moral policing. If the person does hold an ID card and is on duty, the second question to ask is if the actions that caused the policing to start are legal in your juristriction. If it is legal, then that is again moral policing.

3. What is wrong with moral policing?
    Well for starters, it's none of other peoples fucking business what I do or do not do as long as I don't break the law.
