# Introduction

This is a simple guide to understanding what moral policing is, why it is bad, and what you can do about it. 

# Frequently Asked (often unanswered) Questions 

## For the uninitiated and the ignorant

1. What is moral policing?
    
    Moral policing is vigilantism against perceived moral code of a certain society against people who are thought to be acting in a manner that undermines the narrow world view of the vigilante. In plain English, this is the act of policing by people who have a set of moral codes etched in their brains and who think other people should conform to the codes irrespective of whether or not the constitution of the society guarantees certain rights to the people in a democratic country. 

    Let us break down the sentence. Moral police refers to people with no legal authority and not actuall legally appointed law enforcement personnel. Also worth noting is that law enforcement personnel should do exactly what the name suggests: enforce the law. Last I heard, it is legal to kiss somebody in public or hold hands with ones partner. Any law enforcement personnel asking people to NOT hold hands is engaging in moral policing. Moral polcing makes sense only in a country that
    allows for certain freedoms and liberties. In a totallitarean or dictatorship state, it might be against the law to engage in PDA or drink liquor. That is moral policing by the state and is very fucked up. That is not what we are talking about in this FAQ though. Also merely frowning upon or mumbling under their breath or cursing or cussing is not moral policing. Moral policing involves intervention, disruption, violence and direct physical or verbal abuse.

2. Where can I find moral policing?
    
    In India, big time. And in several other (often religious) countries. The wikipedia article on moral policing points squarely to India. 

3. What is the difference between moral policing and policing by law-enforcement authorities?
    
    If the person doing the policing does not have legal authority, i.e, if he does not hold a valid police ID card, then it is moral policing. If the person does hold an ID card and is on duty, the second question to ask is if the actions that caused the policing to start are legal in your juristriction. If it is legal, then that is again moral policing.

3. What is wrong with moral policing?
    
    Well for starters, it's none of other peoples fucking business what I do or do not do as long as I don't break the law. 

4. What are usually policed?
    
    Anything that the moral police find offensive to their culture. Examples include clothing (particularly women), drinking alcohol (particularly women), smoking (particularly women), not wearing a religious attire (particularly women), public displays of affection like kissing or holding hands, partying, pubs, interaction between boys and girls/men and women, celebrations of western special days like valentines day/halloween, cosplays, greeting cards for said days, just anything
    really!


5. Why are the moral police generally against?

    Some claim that they are trying to preserve the culture. Some actually say they are actually trying to reduce crime agianst women by making women wear decent clothes. All of these arguments are bullshit. 

6. Give me some examples of moral policing in real-life.


7. What is public display of affection?

    Public display of affection is displaying love in public spaces. Public spaces are malls, beaches, roads, parking lots, any public space commonly shared. Display of affection could be shaking hands, kissing, hugging, huggling (different), fondling, caressing, holding hands, etc. It does not include, voyuerism, groping or sex. Exposing genitals are considered unacceptable (like by everybody except a handful) and is outright illegal too[Ref: 2]. Voyuerism and groping are
    non-consensual and as such not expressions of affection. So that's out of the question. 

8. Liquor is bad

    It is. But also legal. 

9. Legality of moral policing.

    This is a tricky question. Most times, moral policing is illegal. 

    Section 294 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which deals with "public decency and morals", to justify instances of moral policing. The section states, "Whoever, to the annoyance of other, does any obscene act in any public place ... shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three months, or with fine, or with both." This law is prone to abuse due to there being no fixed definition of what constitutes an "obscene act"

## For the victims of moral policing

1. How can I be more sensitive about certain issues?

    Understand that there are still people who are repulsed by such acts. They have no rights to interfere in your private business and you have every right to kiss your partner or wear whatever you want. But it's good to be sensitive towards the societal norms of the place you are in. It's best (for your own safety) to not attract attention towards you by being the odd ones out. Have fun. Just don't be stupid. 

2. Is there a point that can be described as "crossing the line" for us?

    Sex. And sex like acts. Why? See [ref: 2]
    
3. What to do about moral policing?

    Two camps. 1. Stand your ground and fight for your rights. 2. Be diplomatic and exit the situation because you are probably facing a bunch of senseless idiots. In any case, learn how to physically defend yourself. Learn Krav Maga. Speak out. Write blogs. 

4. How do I protect myself?

    If you are in imminent danger, exit the situation. Use verbal judo. Don't escalate things. Use diplomacy. See above.

## For those that think moral policing is (okay|acceptable|good)

1. What is wrong with moral policing?

    Everything. Firstly, It's none of your business. Secondly, you think you have a moral high ground to preach others. You don't. Thirdly, some of you violent ones totally forget that your expressions of hatred are completely acceptable while simple expressions of love are not. More to come..

2. But I am trying to preserve the dignity and honour of the country.

    You are not. What you are doing is to simply insult the value the country stands for. You rob people of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the constitution that you are supposed to uphold. There's no dignity or honour in that. You're just a mean bully if you engage in policing. Engage in a healthy debate (with interested parties) instead.

3. But I am trying to preserve our culture.

    You are not. You are simply resisting change. Our culture used to be much worse earlier. Lower caste women were not allowed to cover their breasts while they walked through lands belonging to higher caste people. Widows were burnt along with the corpses of their husbands. These were part of our culture back then. Times have changed. You need to strive to promote love, respect and freedom of thought and expression instead of being stuck in dogma.

4. But it is against the tenets of my religion.

    Probably. But like a good person once said:

    Religion is like a penis. It's okay to have one, it's okay to be proud of yours. 
    But don't go waving it about when you walk in public.

5. PDA is disgusting

    For you, maybe. But that's your problem. The fact that the country has been allowing people to shit and piss in public is even more disgusting. And we still have manual scavengers and people who go into sewers and clean shit with their bare hands. These things are actually harmful and not at all in accordance with our culture. And I haven't heard of any stories where you morally policed those who let these things happen. Have you?

6. The society cannot be expected to change.

    The only response I can muster to this is you're full of shit.

7. The larger world view is against (insert something that offends you)

    - Requries a better answer than the one I'm thinking of right now.

## List of fallacious arguments 

- What will you do if your mother or sister wear revealing clothes? Would you not reprimand them?
- We are actually making sure women are safe by teaching them not to provocate men to rape them [victim blaming]
- Your [insert act] is not Indian culture. It is degrading of the cultural values of India
- You are simply copying western culture. That is bad.
- My religion does not allow [insert stuff]
- By doing it, you are insulting [insert religion].
- You are waging war against [insert religion].
- You are a left wing / commie / maoist / naxalite [well, shit!]
- Dressing improperly is a distraction to students [isn't]
